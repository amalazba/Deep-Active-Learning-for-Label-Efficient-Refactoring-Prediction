# DAL: Repository Contents

This repository contains the implementation, features, and results of a Deep Active Learning for Label-Efficient Refactoring Prediction developed for predicting refactoring opportunities at the class, method, and variable levels.

## 📁 Repository Structure and Content

### 1. Code
- A Jupyter notebook `TBStacking_Ensemble v8.ipynb` implementing the TB-Stacking ensemble model.
- Performs binary classification for refactoring prediction at three levels: class, method, and variable.
- Uses tree-based classifiers as base and meta learners.
- Includes cross-validation and feature selection.
